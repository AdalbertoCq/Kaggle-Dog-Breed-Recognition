WIP: Testing on own data set.

Testing CNN models:
  * Xception: [Xception: Deep Learning with Depthwise Separable Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357)
    * Transfer Learning, no fine tuning validation accuracy: 85%
    * Fine tunning validation accuracy: 73%.
  * InceptionResNetV2: [Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261)
  
Used data augmentation and tranfer learning. For the latter, tested both methods fine tuning and just CNN pretrainned weitghs.
